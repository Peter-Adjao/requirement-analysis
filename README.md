# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.


## What is Requirement Analysis?
üìå Requirement Analysis in Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
üîé What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the first and one of the most crucial phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
It involves gathering, analyzing, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders (clients, users, business managers, developers, etc.) for a software system.

The primary goal is to clearly define what the system should do (functional requirements) and how well it should perform (non-functional requirements), so developers can design and build a system that meets user needs.

## üìå Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

* Requirement Gathering

Collecting needs from stakeholders using interviews, surveys, observation, questionnaires, brainstorming sessions, or workshops.

* Requirement Elicitation

Digging deeper into the requirements to uncover hidden, conflicting, or unclear needs.

* Requirement Analysis & Prioritization

Reviewing requirements for feasibility, consistency, and prioritizing them based on importance and constraints (budget, time, resources).

* Requirement Documentation (SRS ‚Äì Software Requirement Specification)

Creating a formal document called the SRS that lists all functional and non-functional requirements.

This serves as a blueprint for design, development, and testing teams.

* Requirement Validation

Ensuring the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are complete, realistic, and testable.

## üèóÔ∏è Types of Requirements

* Functional Requirements

Describe what the system should do.

Example: ‚ÄúThe system must allow users to log in with a username and password.‚Äù

* Non-Functional Requirements

Define how the system should perform.

Example: ‚ÄúThe system should respond to user requests within 2 seconds.‚Äù

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
### üåç Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

* Foundation for Development

Provides a clear roadmap for developers, reducing ambiguity and misunderstandings.

* Reduces Rework and Costs

Errors in requirements, if discovered later (in design or testing), are very expensive to fix. Proper analysis prevents costly mistakes.

* Improves Communication

Serves as a bridge between stakeholders and the technical team, ensuring everyone is on the same page.

* Ensures User Satisfaction

Captures the actual needs of end-users, leading to a product that solves their problems effectively.

* Basis for Testing

Test cases are designed based on the requirements. If requirements are unclear, testing will also be flawed.

* Supports Project Planning

Helps estimate time, cost, and resources needed for development.

### ‚úÖ Example in Practice

Imagine building an e-commerce website:

Functional Requirement: Users should be able to add products to a shopping cart and proceed to checkout.

Non-Functional Requirement: The system should handle 10,000 concurrent users during peak sales without crashing.

If these are not clearly analyzed and documented, developers might build a system that works for basic needs but fails under real-world conditions.

### Conclusion

Requirement Analysis is the cornerstone of successful software development. It ensures that software is built right the first time, aligns with stakeholder expectations, minimizes risks, and optimizes cost and time.
Without a thorough requirement analysis, projects are highly likely to face scope creep, budget overruns, delays, and dissatisfied users.
